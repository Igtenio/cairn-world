This page is specifically for my world and game of Cairn.

"*Cairn* is an adventure game about exploring a dark and mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly."

"*Block, Dodge, Parry* started out as a toolbox for running Cairn. Over time, through playtesting and feedback, it has developed into what you have in front of you know; both a toolbox *and* a complete TTRPG."

I've included rules here based on the second edition of Cairn, and V2 of BPD. It's a sort of Cairn v1.5, if you will. More rules to give the non-combat scenes legs, but not so much to limit the *rulings over rules* nature of OSR.

I did what I could to add Non-Weapon Proficiencies, in other words, and thus made no one happy. Praise Be to AD&D 2E.

Cairn is a game that values community contributions. This one, not so much. It's more of a place to keep notes for myself on setting and rules. If you want to crib anything for yourself, feel free to.
