This page is specifically for my world and game of Cairn.

[Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/), written by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com), is an adventure game about exploring a dark and mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Character generation is quick and random, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly. I've included rules here based on the second edition, with some hacks to match my style of play.

Cairn is a game that values community contributions. This one, not so much. It's more of a place to keep notes for myself on setting and rules. If you want to crib anything for yourself, feel free to.
