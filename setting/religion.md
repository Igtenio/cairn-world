# Religion

Like the real world, religion is not some unified thing. While the majority of religions agree on certain aspects, even if it's just *terms*, many disagree on parts or even the whole story. They can have unique terms for their believers, buildings, and practices.

## Common Beliefs
Once, the gods existed among man. While still distant, they guided and protected their faithful, turning aside natural disasters, preventing incursions from other worlds, and teaching mankind what it would need to know to set out on its' own in the wider world.

Then they disappeared. Prayers went unanswered, and when religious heads, who had spoken directly with them, tried to communicate directly with their masters, they died, muttering visions of carnage and bloodshed. Seemingly within a fortnight, the senior leadership of every religion was decapitated, dying as they attempted to pass on what they had seen.

Without the protections offered by otherworldly powers, some kingdoms went to war immediately, others when their supplies began to dwindle from bad harvests. Still others, which could avoid conquest, were overtaken when beings came from the sky or ground, looking to consume them. Entire nations marched to their deaths just so they wouldn't die in their beds.

## Types of Believers

**Mourners** is the typical epithet used for someone who believes in a god or gods who died. They typically hold their **Vigils** in a **Temple**, with personal appeals to a deity, called **Rites**, held when appropriate. Most rites are minor; a gesture, a recitation, an appeal of some sort, some combination, and that's it. Longer ones may be used for specific affairs. These temples are led by a **Priest**.

Mourners, much like the real world, can be monolatrists(A small fishing village might have a temple in remembrance of a water deity), more equitable polytheism(Someone offering a rite to a merchant deity before making a large trade deal, then stopping at a temple for a deity of a travel before leaving the town), or something inbetween(A house having small steles to a hearth goddess and farm god).

**Believers** are those who believe in one or, less commonly, more living deities. The typical belief is a monotheistic one; while there may have been many gods in the past, there's only one now. How that god arose varies by the religion. Believers who're polytheistic tend to be animistic or engage in ancestor worship.

**Atheists**, rarer still, are those who don't believe in the possibility of gods existing, now or ever. Reasons vary, as they do with people.
