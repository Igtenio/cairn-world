## About
The Ministry is a disparate collection of practitioners dedicated to both furthering the abilities of their adherents and helping people on the frontiers of civilization.

## Beliefs
While beliefs vary amongst individual priests, certain aspects remain identical to the organization as a whole. The Ministry itself preaches that when a person passes on, their soul enters into the wheel of creation, where it's reincarnated after a period of time to wash away its' memories life. The world wasn't always like this, though; while the natural state of the world is one of reincarnation, when the gods still existed, particularly virtuous or vile souls were removed from the wheel and given their own places to dwell. With the death of the gods, those paradises fell to ruin, as did the gates of the prisons, and those souls returned to the wheel.

While not formerly taught, it's not unknown for certain priests to insinuate or outright claim to themselves be some of these elected souls, returned to help mankind in the wake of the disappearance of the gods. Rarely are these claims made to other Ministry figures.
