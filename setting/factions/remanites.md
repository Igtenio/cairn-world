## About

The Cult of Reman, commonly known as Remanites when encountered, are a religious philosophy dedicated to following the path of Reman.

Reman, often called Emperor Reman, is generally believed to be the first new ruler crowned after 0 NE. Remanite philosophy holds that Reman, mastering himself and his surroundings, ascended to Heaven and retroactively killed the gods, begetting his own crowning.

## Beliefs

A key component of Remanite belief is in that of violence. Venerated as an art form, violence is seen as not only present in every act of creation, but considered the ultimate form of dominance which can be wielded during both Conquests.

It believes in two distinct paths to power and ascension; Conquest of the Seas, and Conquest of the Skies.

Conquest of the Seas is an internal struggle, a stilling of desires through alternating periods of hedonistic indulgence and ascetic mortification. The Remanite indulges in every experience, using them as whetstones against their own being in an attempt to grind away weakness and shape themselves into a being closer to Reman himself.

Conquest of the Skies is an external struggle, one in which the Remanite exerts dominance over ones' surroundings through whichever means are available in an attempt to overcome their social and physical limitations. While the stereotype is one of violent domination, this isn't necessarily the case; whatever methods allows a Remanite overt control over their environment and the people therein is considered justifiable, albeit the ultimate power in all cases is violence. After all, unlike other methods of domination, one doesn't need to worry that subjugation through violence results in them ultimately being subjugated.

## History

The Cult of Reman is not a singular faction or religion. Cults tend to spring up where the more esoteric books on Reman are found, or budding off from existing Cultists when their followers go off to make their own way.

The Cult seemingly dates back to the reign of Reman himself, with followers attempting to emulate him. Once Reman vacated the throne in 57 NE, popularity died down, and the final blow for "mainstream" worship of what's always been a niche religion seemed to be the end of the Reman Dynasty in 322 NE.

Remanites preach Reman to be a Worldly God, birthed of the land itself from King Hrold, a King who survived 0 NE, and an incarnation of the land itself, Law made Flesh. He ascended in 57 NE, the year in which his human Empire became the Divine Empire, one which cleared out the old gods retroactively, guaranteeing Reman's ascension to the throne and Heaven.

Remanites believe Reman still reigns over the world to this day from his heavenly throne. While other religions believe the lack of communications from their gods are due to their deaths, Remanites see it as part of his plan; the world is a crucible in which to shape the weak clay of man into something more. Without the hardships and weaknesses imposed by the world, Reman himself could not ascend; that is what he wishes for his own. To cut and harden themselves into better shapes, and ascend heaven through violence.

## Selected Quotes

> Pelinal Whitestrake was the enemy of all huldrene that lived in those days. Mainly, though, he took it upon himself to slay the sorcerer-kings in pre-arranged open combats rather than at war; the fields of rebellion he left to the growing armies of El-Estia. Pelinal called out Haromir of Copper and Tea into a duel at the Tor, and ate his neck-veins while screaming praise to Reman, a name that no one knew yet.

> "You have dishonored your station, me, and our empire. Why did you attempt this and for whom?"
> 
> He got back only a proud laughter the color of bruise and these cracked words from the restless West: "The High Crown Reman who lets priory girls fight his duels asks me this? That you have no idea why or wherefrom this sword issue came, this only underscores your unworthy claims of sovereignty and your misbegotten birth in dirt. You were just another rumor of snakes to us, it seemed, but after twelve years you have finally proved that here."

> Reman took the knight's helm off during this accusation to see the vulgar mouth more clearly, the lips and teeth that framed him to this barbaric angle, and then the Chim-el Adabal in his forehead erupted into balefire, saying, "None But Ourself". Reman then bit out the knight's teeth with his own, growling against and with this new-known power, worrying the lower jaw until it tore free, his hands held hard against the knight's flailing and now tongueless chokes, and his biting increased into a skipping blur until the knight's face exploded into his own.

> Reman then had two aspects himself, a red and ragged mask of the West hanging from temple to neck, and through its tears the glow of righteous Niben, and to Sed-Yenna and Shonni-Et he spoke in this manner, saying, "Tell me now what else does not believe in or belong to me."
