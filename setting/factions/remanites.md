## About

The Cult of Reman, commonly known as Remanites when encountered, are a religious philosophy dedicated to following the path of Reman.

Reman, often called Emperor Reman, is generally believed to be the first new ruler crowned after 0 NE. Remanite philosophy holds that Reman, mastering himself and his surroundings, ascended to Heaven and retroactively killed the gods, begetting his own crowning.

## Beliefs

A key component of Remanite belief is in that of violence. Venerated as an art form, violence is seen as not only present in every act of creation, but considered the ultimate form of dominance which can be wielded during both Conquests.

It believes in two distinct paths to power and ascension; Conquest of the Seas, and Conquest of the Skies.

Conquest of the Seas is an internal struggle, a stilling of desires through alternating periods of hedonistic indulgence and ascetic mortification. The Remanite indulges in every experience, using them as whetstones against their own being in an attempt to grind away weakness and shape themselves into a being closer to Reman himself.

Conquest of the Skies is an external struggle, one in which the Remanite exerts dominance over ones' surroundings through whichever means are available in an attempt to overcome their social and physical limitations. While the stereotype is one of violent domination, this isn't necessarily the case; whatever methods allows a Remanite overt control over their environment and the people therein is considered justifiable, albeit the ultimate power in all cases is violence. After all, unlike other methods of domination, one doesn't need to worry that subjugation through violence results in them ultimately being subjugated.

## History

The Cult of Reman is not a singular faction or religion. Cults tend to spring up where the more esoteric books on Reman are found, or budding off from existing Cultists when their followers go off to make their own way.

The Cult seemingly dates back to the reign of Reman himself, with followers attempting to emulate him. Once Reman vacated the throne in 57 NE, popularity died down, and the final blow for "mainstream" worship of what's always been a niche religion seemed to be the end of the Reman Dynasty in 322 NE.

Remanites preach Reman to be a Worldly God, birthed of the land itself from King Hrold, a King who survived 0 NE, and an incarnation of the land itself, Law made Flesh. He ascended in 57 NE, the year in which his human Empire became the Divine Empire, one which cleared out the old gods retroactively, guaranteeing Reman's ascension to the throne and Heaven.

Remanites believe Reman still reigns over the world to this day from his heavenly throne. While other religions believe the lack of communications from their gods are due to their deaths, Remanites see it as part of his plan; the world is a crucible in which to shape the weak clay of man into something more. Without the hardships and weaknesses imposed by the world, Reman himself could not ascend; that is what he wishes for his own. To cut and harden themselves into better shapes, and ascend heaven through violence.
