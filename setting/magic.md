# Magic

In the modern age, two types of magic are known to people.

## Arcane Magic

Arcane Magic is ye olde Wizard magic; fireballs, lightning bolts, throwing objects with your mind, and so on. Crucially, Arcane Magic is an **externalized** form of magic; arcane casters are unable to affect themselves, only external objects and people. While there're ways around this limitation through off-loading the target to, say, enchant a robe with protections instead of applying them directly, or teamwork to enchant each other, this doesn't change that wizards require tools and trust for their greatest works.

## Divine Magic

Divine Magic is the term used for the magic wielded by priests and others who wield it on behalf of some sort of patron, living or dead. Divine Magic differs from the arcane in that it's solely **internalized**; a priest can do anything from heal better by sharpening their senses and steadying their hands to become something akin to an old Avatar of War by turning their skin steel-like and making their weapons hit like lightning.

The biggest downside to Divine Magic is that, being an internal force, it's always singular. While a group of priests can be a formidable fighting force, or prove a valuable force for good in healing, their abilities can never be more than the sum of their parts.
