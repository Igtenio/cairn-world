# Magic

In the modern age, two types of magic are widely known to people. While others might exist, these are the two you could ask just about anyone about and they'd point out.

## Manifestations

Manifestations, also known as arcane magic, is ye olde Wizarde magic; fireballs, lightning bolts, throwing objects with your mind, and so on. Crucially, Manifestations is an **externalized** form of magic; arcane casters are unable to affect themselves, only external objects and people. While there're ways around this limitation through off-loading the target to, say, enchant a robe with protections instead of applying them directly, or teamwork to enchant each other, this doesn't change that wizards require tools and trust for their greatest works.

## Emanations

Emanations, colloquially known as and formally defined as divine magic, is the term used for the magic wielded by priests and others who wield it on behalf of some sort of patron, living or dead. Emanations differs from the arcane in that it's solely **internalized**; a priest can do anything from heal better by sharpening their senses and steadying their hands to become something akin to an old Avatar of War by turning their skin steel-like and making their weapons hit like a rock launched from a siege engine.

The biggest downside to Emanations is that, being an internal force, it's always singular. While a group of priests can be a formidable fighting force, or prove a valuable force for good in healing, their abilities can never be more than the sum of their parts.

# Limitations to Manifestations and Emanations

For unknown reasons, Manifestations and Emanations seem diametrically opposed to each other; while this doesn't impact their utilization, it does prevent any singular individual from learning both types. This even applies to unknown potential; more than once a novice priest or mage has learned that their inability to work magic isn't from anything they've done wrong, but a latent ability in the other type of magic.

This issue is often found more quickly in the cities, where it's typical for initiates who're struggling to be tested by two-person teams of priests and mages for the purpose of finding potential in people. Out on the edges, it's much more common for people to just fail out of an organization when they fail to grasp the basics, only to find out they never had a chance.
