# The Basics

All magic works on the same basic system; the differences between Manifestations, Emanations, and others is;

* Pillars that can be learned
* Limits on abilities

That's it. Otherwise, a mage, priest, or anything else operates on these rules.

## Overview

**Practitioners** have one additional stat; **Magic**. Magic has two aspects; a **Practice**(Manifestations, Emanations, et cetera), and a number. The Magic state can be thought of as raw strength in channeling the forces the Practitioner uses. So a valid Magic state might be;

* Magic(Em) 1

This would be the score of an initiate priest, for instance. You can shorthand the Practice however makes sense to you, or write it out entirely. As long as it's clear.

Each Practice has one or more **Limits** which go along with it. They are not societal taboos they should not do, they are hard limits to the ability itself. Any social taboos can certainly be listed to the side here as well, but should be marked clearly.

The Practitioner will also have one or more **Pillars** related to the practice. These are aspects they can manipulate with magic. The number of Pillars a practitioner can know is unrelated to their Magic score; a Manifester with Magic 6 might only know Fire, while another with Magic 1 might know all of them. Pillars represent the flexibility of the Practitioner in channeling their abilities.

Going back to our example of the initiate priest, his full magical stats might be;

* Magic(Em) 1
* Limit: Can only affect their own body with spells(Taboo to heal non-mourners of their god)
* Pillars: Augment(Healing), Mend
