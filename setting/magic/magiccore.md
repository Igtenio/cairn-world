# The Basics

All magic works on the same basic system; the differences between Manifestations, Emanations, and others is;

* Pillars that can be learned
* Limits on abilities

That's it. Otherwise, a mage, priest, or anything else operates on these rules.

## Overview

**Practitioners** have one additional stat; **Magic**. Magic has two aspects; a **Practice**(Manifestations, Emanations, et cetera), and a number. The Magic state can be thought of as raw strength in channeling the forces the Practitioner uses. So a valid Magic state might be;

* Magic(Em) 1

This would be the score of an initiate priest, for instance. You can shorthand the Practice however makes sense to you, or write it out entirely. As long as it's clear.

Each Practice has one or more **Limits** which go along with it. They are not societal taboos they should not do, they are hard limits to the ability itself. Any social taboos can certainly be listed to the side here as well, but should be marked clearly.

The Practitioner will also have one or more **Pillars** related to the practice. These are aspects they can manipulate with magic. The number of Pillars a practitioner can know is unrelated to their Magic score; a Manifester with Magic 6 might only know Fire, while another with Magic 1 might know all of them. Pillars represent the flexibility of the Practitioner in channeling their abilities.

Going back to our example of the initiate priest, his full magical stats might be;

* Magic(Em) 1
* Limit: Can only affect their own body with spells(Taboo to heal non-mourners of their god)
* Pillars: Augment(Healing), Mend

## Mechanics

When a Practitioner uses Magic, they choose a number of empty, available inventory slots to **Invest** in the spellcasting. These inventory slots are blocked off while invested, similar to fatigue, but can be returned at will.

These investments are represented with d6s. It's recommended the d6s be a different color than the player's normal dice, to help differentiate their normal dice from their "Magic Dice". When using spells, these dice are used in a variety of ways; at times, they're merely used as tokens, used to count rerolls or charges. Other times, they're damage dice. Please see the appropriate Pillar for how a particular effect uses them.

These dice remain between effects; if a Practitioner invests 3, they can use the full 3d6 for a Movement, then Damage, then Augment effect.

Practitioners, by default, can only utilize a single Pillar at a time. If they wish to use multiple Pillars simultaneously on distinct effects, the cost is;

* For each additional, separate effect

The remaining investment pool is then split between the two effects.

{: .note }
> Despite the "One Pillar by Default" rule, players should feel free to describe the cosmetic effects as they wish when utilizing singular Pillars; someone wanting to use *Movement* to ram into an enemy and describes them as having streaks of flame because they're a fire mage shouldn't need to also utilize *Damage(Fire)* to conjure fire or *Cantrip* to show an effect, unless they want to pump up the damage beyond hitting an enemy like a truck.
>
> On the other hand, in the same scenario, it's entirely fair to argue the player takes damage too unless they also utilize *Bolster*, considering they're hitting an enemy at terminal velocity.
