## Augment(X)

The Augment Pillar covers all effects which bolster an entities' innate abilities. This can range from physical abilities, such as raw strength, to knowledge of skills. Using Augment, a thief could more easily pick locks, a beast can bite at just the right places to inflict maximum damage, and facts more easily come to mind.

Importantly, Augment *cannot* provide knowledge or abilities outside of what the entity possesses. Healers under the most powerful Augment effects won't just know the antidote to a poison requiring an extinct plant they've never heard of, nor could an adventurer run across lava without being hurt unless a path to do so already exists. Augment allows reaching towards the pinnacle of potential, not *surpassing* it or providing new effects.

**Mechanics:** Each time you select Augment, choose a new type of activity. This activity shouldn't be too broad; a good rule of thumb is that if it's a profession, it's the right scope for Augment. When in doubt if something falls within the purview of the activity using this rule, it's best to err on the side of narrow; if an aspect of the profession is best done by a different profession, it should fall *outside* of the specific Augment taken.

{: .note }
> What constitutes "within the purview" or "outside the purview" of a profession will absolutely vary by your game. While some things should be a no-brainer(The cook should probably...cook), others will just depend, not just on the setting, but also where you are. My recommendation for this disparity is;
>
> A: Consider the smallest, most rural place that profession may be, and base it off that. For instance, Blacksmiths generally never exist without miners; miners are either in mines nearby, or Blacksmiths import the raw goods from mines. Hence, Augment(Blacksmith) should never provide a bonus to mining ore veins. But, if in your world, ores can't be transported for whatever reason, maybe the smallest villages with a Blacksmith have that Blacksmith also mine. In which case, Augment(Blacksmith) absolutely should.
>
> B: Be consistent. Using the above world, someone using Augment(Blacksmith) in the Cities, where Blacksmiths buy all their ore, doesn't lose the mining bonus just because they're in a place the profession don't need to mine, or suddenly gain it if they go to a place they need it.
>
> Obviously, you can adjust this in the interest of making something interesting, but these are good starts.

> Example
>
> The local Priest has Augment(Heal). This helps him when buying herbs and dressings for the Temple, because getting supplies is a core part of professional Healers. Augment helps the Priest get very good supplies.
>
> The town is attacked, and during the siege the Priest needs to make do with scavenged herbs from the forest and bandages. This is also a core part of being a professional Healer; on a battlefield, you make do with what you have. Augment helps keep people alive during this dark day.
>
> After the invaders are repelled, the Priest attempts to scavenge some more supplies where he found the herbs during the battle, to gain more supplies to help the survivors. Generally speaking, this would be the purview of an Herbalist; Healers don't tend to go out and get their own herbs unless it's an emergency. Augment is unable to help in this activity.

When Augment is active and you engage in this activity, you gain advantage to your rolls related to it. This can be both physical and knowledge-based rolls; someone with Augment(Combat) would get the bonus during combat, and when examining a sword for combat-worthiness or sizing up who's leading an ambushing party.

Certain Augment skills will absolutely have overlap; this is completely fine. Augment(Sailing) and Augment(Shipwright) may both provide a bonus if the player activates one and asks about the condition of a vessel for sailing. As long as it's within the purview of the active Augment(s), it's covered.
