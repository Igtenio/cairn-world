## Appearance
From a distance, Weald Elks appear to be larger forms of their natural cousins. Up close, the differences are striking. Built in the skeleton of an elk, but grown larger, the Weald Elk appears to be filled with stone local to the area. Its' exterior is a combination of wood and moss, wood to provide a form of armor, moss as a makeshift skin. The antlers are formed of petrified wood.

The only noise a Weald Elk makes internally is a gentle rumbling of the stones. It'll still graze on grass and leaves, leaving ground "droppings" behind which decompose on their own, but no amount of sustenance can truly sate it.

A Weald Elk is a sort of natural automaton, created by a forest when a particularly greedy or selfish crime has been committed within its' bounds. A Weald Elk will rise within 2d12 hours, and continue to hunt any sentient being within the forest while it exists. Slaying one will only delay it; it reforms in the forests' mien within 2d12 hours.

Weald Elks are typically 5' to 6' 6" at their shoulder, and weigh between 2200lbs and 3000lbs.
