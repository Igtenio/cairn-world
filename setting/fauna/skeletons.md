# Skeletons

## Common Beliefs

No unified belief exists regarding beings referred to as Skeletons. There're certainly beings people may recognize by that name; forests, specially, have a tendency to reuse human remains, creating reanimated skeletons moving with use of vines and moss.

Other beings, once found and killed, match those descriptions. Beings stalking tunnelings in abandoned structures, seemingly just human skeletons transmuted to metal.

## The Truth

The things referred to as Skeletons are sentient, albeit non-living beings. While appearing similar to a human skeleton, closer inspection reveals that their bodies resemble a structure of sorts, animated to move on its' own.

Skeletons are extremely reclusive. While they aren't entirely unknown, they've managed to prevent wide-spread knowledge of their existence through even myth or rumors.
