# The Old Ones

## Common Beliefs

"The Old Ones" typically refers to a supposed race of beings who existed prior to humanity. This race is the one credited with the creation of any unknown structures humanity has found; even ones which seemingly share human construction methods and/or proportions but have an unknown vintage are often credited to Old Ones if of a sufficient age. They vanished long enough ago that no remains can be found, preventing people from knowing what they truly looked like.

The Old Ones, having vanished prior to humanity, predate the death of the gods. Where they went is unknown. Common beliefs include but are not limited to;

- An accident causing them all to vanish simultaneously
- Ascending to become the gods
- Ascending to become rival gods, who later killed the gods of humanity
- Creating the forests which cover the world, and disappearing into them
- Disease spreading amongst them and wiping out the population
- Them being an early version of humanity

As with most things, the more fantastical tales tend to be told by those to whom the tale benefits, while the more banal stories are often the ones given scholarly pursuit due to actual evidence.

## The Truth

The Old Ones are immortal souls which reincarnate, born to humanity but rarely feeling of it, they tend to congregate together. The only thing physically distinguishing them from normal people is that their hair, barring changes, is always naturally grey.

Due to their introversion, even people who know of this aren't aware of the entirety of the truth. The majority of people who've learned the truth assume the Old Ones now are the same ones people refer to discussing the historical Old Ones, and whatever befell them then ended with them somehow living on through reincarnation. In truth, not even the modern Old Ones know; while their memories do span beyond their existing lifetime, and they feel more comfortable in uncivilized spaces, none of the modern members have clear memories beyond a few hundred years in the past.
