# People

People of the world are the same as they are anywhere. Any variations in skin, hair, eyes, et cetera found in the real world can be found here, along with some slightly fantastical ones due to encounters with magic or unknown effects in ruins.

Normal humanity is what makes up known civilization. While other intelligent-seeming entities exist out in the wild, they're either tools of some other power, little more than spectra, or bipedal animals. Humanity is, as far as it knows, alone in the world.
