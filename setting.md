# Setting

There's no glorified name for the world. It's just the world to the inhabitants.

For the most part, it's a fairly typical Cairn world; lots of forest, and that forest is terrifying. A central kingdom which is far off and unknown to people on the fringes of civilization. The major difference is that there are oceans and other biome types mixed in.
