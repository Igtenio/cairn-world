Here, I'm going to try and go over why I'm doing this, the purpose of the setting and rules modifications, and give an outline of my DMing style.

## The Campaign

The game I'm running with this world and modification is a duet game; one DM, one player. Cairn is amazing in a group, but I think purely as a mechanical experience, it falls a little short.[^1] This could be overcome a tidge if the player ran multiple PCs; mine is not. In my experience, duet games need something more. Hence, all this.

[^1]: As many games of the era did and do; Baldur's Gate was amazing specifically for *not* sucking despite running on a game system meant for people who wanted to play squad-based wargames where they named their painted men and imagined their lives between mowing down stuff. There's a reason Fighters specifically got Strongholds; giving them a Malibu Mansion would've revealed exactly what we were all doing.

## Rules Changes

A lot of it is bringing in interesting things from BPD[^BPD], which I think does a lot to make solitary PCs more feasible. For one thing, the careers system is pretty great. I like skills. Things to give some mechanical depth to the non-combat sections.

[^BPD]: The Cairn variant, not the disorder.

## Game Running Ethos

Once, back in the early 00s, I had someone angrily leave my table while DMing because he "just wanted to spend time killing shit, not talk about gay shit like who knows who". Sometimes, I wonder what happened to that guy, and if he knows they made [Gay Shit: The Roleplaying Game](https://rowanrookanddecard.com/product/die-the-roleplaying-game/?v=0b3b97fa6688).

One of the other players, very sympathetic, then said everyone else liked my effete[^2] DMing style.

[^2]: Which is the nicest way, during that era, someone ever called something I did *gay*.

I was a little ahead of the curve in regards to the whole role v roll debate. I liked characters, and stories, and the intersection of motive with intent and means. This manifested in a few different principles.

### Dungeons Shouldn't Feel Designed
I've never been a massive fan of pure dungeon crawling, because it always seemed lazy. We go out to a place, under a place or just by itself, scout it out while killing anything we find, and then take whatever we find. Sometimes, people pay for defusing danger. But that's an incredibly temporary solution; what stops something from moving in afterwards? What was the space intended for? Why don't the townspeople expand out into the dungeon? Why doesn't the kingdom demolish or use it as a fort? Why doesn't the original owner ever come back to find these fucking gnolls here?

It got significantly better over time. Dungeons became more cohesive things over time, where they either existed because they were natural structures things lived in(the Underdark), ruins which couldn't be easily bulldozed(Myth Drannor), or at least having an owner who didn't seem to care what happened elsewhere as long as his sanctum was left alone(Undermountain).

The Underdark isn't an interesting ecology, it's an excuse to take any cave map and put whatever bullshit you want to on it. Beholders and illithids and black elves[^3]? Just a normal day in the ~~hood~~ Underdark.

[^3]: Don't get me started on drow. "Oh, you're a universally evil race cursed by your god with a mark because your ancestors turned against him. That mark is...**dark skin**.". I give zero shits about Wizards scrubbing gypsy stereotypes or intelligent apes from their products when one of the fantasy races uses a common talking point from the 19th century to support separation of the races. "The Mark of Cain was clearly dark skin, and we're supposed to drink from the same fountain as his descendants?"

    For fucks sake, drow all being evil makes more fucking sense. The society is totalitarian douchebaggery from top to bottom. *That's not even the problem I have*. Really missing the fucking forest for the trees there, Wizards. I don't give a fuck about your good jungle drow when they're still half of Run the Jewels due to original fucking sin.

Undermountain is basically the same thing for constructed areas. Why's Halaster Blackcloak both incredibly powerful, thousands of years old, and operating in the Prime Material Plane instead of, I don't know, building his sanctum somewhere in the planes somewhere where people can't literally drop in from a well behind an inn? Because than the boxed set wouldn't be so god damn easy to insert into a campaign, that's why. Easier to be sentenced to Undermountain and gloss over details than have to trek out to a personal reality in the Astral Plane or a giant fuck-all fortress build in the elemental plane of Earth. Get in the sewer, Donatello.

Myth Drannor...I like Myth Drannor. Good history, good reason for not just being bulldozed or resettled. It makes sense.

Dungeons are interesting *when they don't feel more designed than they need to be*. A dungeon used to or is still something; if it was designed by sapient beings we can comprehend, we should design that aspect. Then, ever so carefully, ruin it until it's either reclaimed by hostile nature or repurposed into something else by other sapient beings. It needs to be an original character of its' own, repurposed into something else, like a sailor drafted into a war. If it's not telling a story of what it was and what it is now, then it's just a glorified killbox.

### Characters aren't Hirelings
I hate simple PCs. This doesn't mean every PC needs to be some super badass with grand adventures and dead parents at Level 0; it means the PC needs to be more interesting than a hireling.

If you can't tell me who your PC hates, as juvenile or shallow as that hate may be, or a moment they were incredibly embarrassed, or a time, for no particular reason they acted completely counter to their nature, you have a hireling.

Even in a game where PCs are 100% on the same side, with zero PvP or infighting, PCs shouldn't be the bestest of friends, because the game group deciding that doesn't mean the PCs did. There'll be disagreements, rivalries, and fucking Bruenor making those god damn muffins again despite not getting the hint that no one likes them.

I cannot tell you how elated I was when DIE: The Roleplaying Game provided a clean written system of what I'd been roughly doing for years; interrogating players on what their PCs were like, why the PCs may dislike each other or NPCs, and making it important to the story. It's a beautiful game, and if you haven't read it, you should.

It's why I dislike alignment so strongly; it makes sense that the messenger of a deity could be repelled by spells that target their alignment, but a guy who's generally an alright bloke and follows the law shouldn't be held back by a **Circle of Protection Against Lawful Good**. Is it because humans are so damn neutral? No, they've taken no oath to uphold a balance or whatnot, so they aren't even true neutral. The average human alignment should be blank, because one person's archvillain is another's saint, and both can be correct.
